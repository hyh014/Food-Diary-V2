# Food-Diary-V2

Food diary is a web app that allow users to take picture of their food and rate them based on health, taste, and mood. It also allows
users to create, update, or delete previous entries that they have made.
Food diary was originally as a group project for a school assignment, but I decided to remake the project from scratch as I was unsatisfied
with outcome of the original Food diary web application.

In this new version of Food Diary web app, I decided to get rid of unecessary files such as layouts, that I originally inteded to use, but
ran out of time to implement them. Also, I decided to clean up the code as this was my first web application that I have made and the code
was all over the place. 

The Food Diary web application was written in HTML,CSS(Bootstrap), and JavaScript/JQuery. For backend management, I used Node.js with express
and for database management, I used Firebase Authentication and realtime database.
